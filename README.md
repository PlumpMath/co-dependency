# stuartsierra/component co-dependency facility
Based in original co-dependency idea of [Malcolm Sparks](https://github.com/juxt/component) to achieve co-dependency relation in 
[stuartsierra/component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) library.

This co-dependency proposal is designed on the idea that component doesn't need co-dependencies to start, 
so this assoc-co-dependencies functionality can be applied to a started system, so can be though as a second system start process.

## Releases and Dependency Information
